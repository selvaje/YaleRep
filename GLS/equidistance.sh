# Equidistant Cylindrical Projection (Equirectangular Projection)
# Description: In this projection, distances are preserved along meridians and parallels. The projection is created by mapping latitudes and longitudes onto a regular grid, and it's useful for mapping regions close to the equator. However, distortion increases as you move away from the equator.
# Common Uses: World maps, thematic maps.
# EPSG Code:
# WGS 84 Equidistant Cylindrical (Plate Carr√©e): EPSG: 32662 (for WGS 84 datum).
